# Authentication

What stays constant across every app, and the one real choice: **which token**.

## Constant: hashing + dependency guards

- **bcrypt** for passwords (`bcrypt>=4.2`). Never store or log plaintext.
- Auth is expressed as **FastAPI dependencies**, not middleware, so each route
  declares its own requirement and you get it for free in the OpenAPI schema.

```python
# security.py
import bcrypt

MAX_PASSWORD_BYTES = 72


def password_bytes(pw: str) -> bytes:
    encoded = pw.encode("utf-8")
    if len(encoded) > MAX_PASSWORD_BYTES:
        raise ValueError(f"Password must be at most {MAX_PASSWORD_BYTES} UTF-8 bytes")
    return encoded


def hash_password(pw: str) -> str:
    return bcrypt.hashpw(password_bytes(pw), bcrypt.gensalt()).decode()


def verify_password(pw: str, hashed: str) -> bool:
    # Do not apply the creation policy here: old hashes may predate it.
    return bcrypt.checkpw(pw.encode("utf-8"), hashed.encode("utf-8"))
```

### Password length is a creation-time policy

Classic bcrypt only consumes the first 72 **bytes**, so a character-count limit
is insufficient: a Unicode password can cross the boundary well before 72
characters. Enforce the UTF-8 byte limit in the lowest shared hashing function,
then route every password-creation path through it: registration, invitations,
reset, profile change, admin creation, and model/service convenience methods.
Endpoint-only validation is bypassed as soon as a background job or new caller
uses the service directly.

Do not apply the new maximum in `verify_password`. Verification is an
authentication compatibility path, not password creation; rejecting a long
candidate before bcrypt sees it can lock out accounts whose hashes were created
under an older policy. Apply the limit when a password is newly set or replaced,
while allowing verification to check existing hashes.

Test the policy at both layers:

```python
def test_password_limit_counts_utf8_bytes():
    assert len(password_bytes("a" * 72)) == 72
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        password_bytes("é" * 37)  # 74 UTF-8 bytes, only 37 characters


def test_verification_does_not_apply_creation_policy(monkeypatch):
    seen = {}

    def fake_checkpw(candidate, _hash):
        seen["candidate"] = candidate
        return False

    monkeypatch.setattr(bcrypt, "checkpw", fake_checkpw)
    verify_password("x" * 73, "stored-hash")
    assert len(seen["candidate"]) == 73
```

Also test every public creation entry point rejects an over-limit value. Those
tests catch duplicated validation that later drifts away from the central rule.

```python
# api/deps.py
async def current_user(...) -> User | None: ...        # may be anonymous
async def require_user(user=Depends(current_user)) -> User:
    if user is None:
        raise HTTPException(401)
    return user
async def require_admin(user=Depends(require_user)) -> User:
    if user.role != "admin":
        raise HTTPException(403)
    return user

UserDep  = Annotated[User, Depends(require_user)]
AdminDep = Annotated[User, Depends(require_admin)]
```

### Timing-safe lookups

On login, if the email doesn't exist, still run a dummy bcrypt verify before
returning failure. Otherwise response time reveals which emails are registered.
Use `hmac.compare_digest` for comparing tokens/CSRF values.

## The choice: which token

Pick **one** scheme per app based on who calls the API. The guards above don't
change — only how `current_user` resolves a request to a user.

### 1. Cookie-JWT — browser apps (server-rendered)

JWT (HS256, `pyjwt`) stored in an **httponly, `samesite=lax`, `secure`-in-prod**
cookie. Best default for a Jinja-rendered app: no token handling in JS, and the
cookie can't be read by scripts. Add CSRF protection for state-changing POSTs.

### 2. Bearer-JWT / API key — programmatic or SPA clients

`HTTPBearer`; the SPA stores the access token and sends `Authorization: Bearer`.
Issue short-lived access + longer refresh tokens with a `type` claim. For
machine clients, issue API keys (`sk_live_...`): show once, store only a **SHA-256
hash**, look up by hash.

### 3. Magic link — passwordless

Email a single-use, signed, expiring link; clicking it mints a session token. No
passwords to store or leak. Good for low-friction consumer signups.

### 4. OAuth — delegated identity

Authorization-code flow against a provider (Google, GitHub, a domain-specific
provider). **Always validate the `state` parameter** to block login-CSRF. Encrypt
any third-party access/refresh tokens at rest (e.g. a SQLAlchemy `TypeDecorator`
that encrypts on the way in and decrypts on the way out).

## CSRF (cookie-based auth only)

If auth rides in a cookie, the browser attaches it automatically, so you need CSRF
protection on state-changing requests: a per-session token rendered into forms and
checked on POST with `hmac.compare_digest`. Token-in-header schemes (bearer) are not
CSRF-exposed and don't need this.

**Rendering a token is not enforcing one.** The frequent failure is per-form
opt-in: CSRF is only checked where a handler explicitly validates the token (a
`validate_on_submit()` / an equivalent dependency), so dropping a hidden token
field into a template does nothing on its own. Any handler that reads the raw
request body directly — a file-upload endpoint reading uploaded files, an admin
POST reading raw form fields — stays wide open, and the template's token is
decorative. Enforce CSRF **globally** (a single middleware/extension that rejects
any unsafe-method request lacking a valid token), then carve out exceptions
deliberately, rather than remembering to add the check on every new route. Audit
by grepping for handlers that read request bodies but never touch the token.

**A state-changing GET can't be CSRF-protected at all.** If a GET request mutates
state — deactivating an account, confirming an unsubscribe, deleting a row behind a
plain `<a href>` — no token scheme saves you: the browser will fire it from an
`<img src>` on any page, and link prefetchers and email scanners trigger it with no
user action. A client-side `confirm()` dialog is not protection; the attacker's
request never sees it. Mutations must use POST/DELETE (so CSRF enforcement and
same-site cookie rules apply); reserve GET for reads.

## Protecting FastAPI's OpenAPI schema

Setting `docs_url=None` and `redoc_url=None` hides the interactive UIs, but
FastAPI still registers `/openapi.json` whenever `openapi_url` is non-`None`.
That built-in route is registered before later decorators, so adding a guarded
`@app.get("/openapi.json")` without disabling the built-in route leaves the schema
public: the built-in handler shadows the guarded one.

Disable automatic registration, then serve the schema yourself:

```python
app = FastAPI(docs_url=None, redoc_url=None, openapi_url=None)

@app.get("/openapi.json", include_in_schema=False)
async def private_openapi(_: AdminDep) -> dict:
    return app.openapi()
```

Schema generation still works when `openapi_url=None`; only the automatic route
is disabled. Add regression tests proving an anonymous request receives `401` or
`403`, an authorized request receives `200`, and the response contains `"openapi"`.
Inspect `app.routes` if duplicate paths are suspected—a passing authorized test
alone will not reveal that an earlier public handler won routing precedence.

## Client identity behind reverse proxies

Rate limits, security logs, and abuse controls are only as strong as their client
IP derivation. Never take the left-most `X-Forwarded-For` value: clients can
usually supply it themselves, and permissive proxy-header middleware may expose
that attacker-controlled value as `request.client.host`.

Define the deployment topology explicitly. If traffic always crosses a known
number of trusted proxies, read the forwarded chain **right to left** and select
the address immediately before those hops. Reject a short or malformed chain and
fall back to the direct peer; do not guess.

```python
from ipaddress import ip_address

from fastapi import Request


def trusted_client_ip(request: Request, *, trusted_proxy_hops: int = 1) -> str:
    peer = request.client.host if request.client else "unknown"
    forwarded = request.headers.get("x-forwarded-for")
    if not forwarded or trusted_proxy_hops < 1:
        return peer

    chain = [part.strip() for part in forwarded.split(",")]
    if len(chain) < trusted_proxy_hops:
        return peer

    try:
        # Extra client-supplied entries on the left cannot change this position.
        return str(ip_address(chain[-trusted_proxy_hops]))
    except ValueError:
        return peer
```

This is safe only when the application is reachable exclusively through those
proxies and the edge proxy overwrites or appends the header as expected. If the
application also accepts direct traffic, first verify that the direct peer is in
an explicit trusted-proxy network; otherwise ignore all forwarding headers.

Test the production path, not just the helper. Wrap the ASGI app in the same
proxy-header middleware and trust configuration used by the server, then send
requests with different left-most spoofed values but the same right-most trusted
client address. They must consume the same rate-limit bucket. Also cover missing,
short, and malformed chains, and reset any module-level in-memory limiter between
tests so bucket state cannot leak across cases.
