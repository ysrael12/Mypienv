# Python Code Quality

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| ruff | Lint + format | `ruff check src && ruff format src` |
| mypy | Type check | `mypy src` |

## Ruff Configuration

Minimal config in pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py310"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "W", "F", "I", "B", "C4", "UP"]
```

For full configuration options, see **[RUFF_CONFIG.md](RUFF_CONFIG.md)**.

## MyPy Configuration

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.10"
disallow_untyped_defs = true
warn_return_any = true
```

For strict settings and overrides, see **[MYPY_CONFIG.md](MYPY_CONFIG.md)**.

## Type Hints Patterns

```python
# Basic
def process(items: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]: ...

# Optional
def fetch(url: str, timeout: int | None = None) -> bytes: ...

# Callable
def apply(func: Callable[[int], str], value: int) -> str: ...

# Generic
T = TypeVar("T")
def first(items: Sequence[T]) -> T | None: ...
```

For protocols and advanced patterns, see **[TYPE_PATTERNS.md](TYPE_PATTERNS.md)**.

## Common Anti-Patterns

```python
# Bad: Mutable default
def process(items: list = []):  # Bug!
    ...

# Good: None default
def process(items: list | None = None):
    items = items or []
    ...
```

```python
# Bad: Bare except
try:
    ...
except:
    pass

# Good: Specific exception
try:
    ...
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(e)
```

```python
# Bad: truthiness guard swallows a legitimate 0 / 0.0 / "" / False
hour = config.get("start_hour") or 9   # a valid 0 (midnight) silently becomes 9
if self.max_drawdown:                  # max_drawdown=0 silently disables the limit
    enforce(self.max_drawdown)

# Good: guard on None, not on truthiness
hour = config.get("start_hour")
hour = 9 if hour is None else hour
if self.max_drawdown is not None:
    enforce(self.max_drawdown)
```

`x = x or default` is fine only when the single falsy value you mean to replace
is an empty container (e.g. `items = items or []`). For numeric, boolean, or
string fields where `0`, `False`, or `""` are meaningful inputs, it is a bug —
use `x if x is not None else default`.

```python
# Bad: identity comparison against a literal (ruff flags this as F632)
if name is not "":   # CPython interning makes it *sometimes* work — never rely on it

# Good: value comparison
if name != "":
```

## A Rule You Enabled Isn't a Rule That Fires

Linters ship exemptions, and the costly ones are invisible: the rule is in
`select`, the job is green, and the class of mistake you believed was policed
walks straight through. Before relying on a check to protect something, write
the violation on purpose once and confirm it gets reported.

The Ruff default that bites hardest is `dummy-variable-rgx`. It exists so
`_`-prefixed throwaways don't trip unused-variable checks, but its default
pattern matches **any** leading-underscore name — so `F811` (redefinition of an
unused name) ignores every private helper in the codebase.

```python
# module.py — two module-level definitions. The FIRST one is dead code.
def _is_rate_limited(response):          # never called; editing it has no effect
    return response.status_code == 403

def _is_rate_limited(response):          # this is the one that wins
    return response.status_code == 403 and "rate limit" in response.text.lower()
```

`ruff check --select F811` passes clean on that file. Rename both to
`is_rate_limited` and it fires immediately (verified on ruff 0.16). The gate is
working — the *name* opted out of it.

This shape shows up most often after two branches independently add the same
module-level helper and a conflict resolution keeps both sides. Nothing goes
red; the bodies usually agree at first; then someone patches the dead copy and
cannot work out why the behaviour didn't change.

Prefer fixing it in config, so the check actually covers private names:

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
dummy-variable-rgx = "^_$"   # only a bare `_` is a throwaway
```

State the tradeoff honestly before adopting it: `_, keep = pair()` stays silent,
but `_unused = compute()` now trips `F841`. In a codebase that leans on `_name`
throwaways that is real noise — delete the assignment or use a bare `_` rather
than reverting the regex.

Independently, after resolving a conflict in a module both branches edited, look
for duplicated definitions directly — this catches shadowing the linter's
config can't:

```bash
grep -oE '^(def|class) [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*' module.py | sort | uniq -d
```

The habit generalizes past Ruff: when a check is load-bearing, introduce the
mistake once and watch it get caught, the same way a regression test is only
trustworthy after you've seen it go red.

## Fail Loud: Don't Degrade Silently

The costliest bugs aren't crashes — they're failures that look like success. Code
that swallows an error and returns something plausible corrupts data downstream
with no signal that anything went wrong. Prefer raising, or at minimum surfacing
an explicit error, over a quiet fallback.

**Don't collapse exceptions into a generic string — and don't discard output.**

```python
# Bad: real parse error becomes a one-line string; traceback and context lost
try:
    return parse(path)
except Exception as e:
    return {"error": str(e)}     # every distinct failure looks the same

# Bad: a nonzero exit discards stdout — where many CLIs write their real summary
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
if result.returncode != 0:
    return f"Error: {result.stderr}"   # tools that exit nonzero *by design*
                                       # (e.g. "N findings") report empty here

# Good: let it raise (or return stdout+stderr+code so the caller can decide)
return {"stdout": result.stdout, "stderr": result.stderr, "code": result.returncode}
```

**Give success and failure distinct sentinels.** If the error path writes the
same status value the success path uses, failed runs read as complete.

```python
# Bad: on failure, status is set to the SAME value that means "done"
try:
    run_job()
    status = "READY"
except Exception:
    status = "READY"     # failures are now indistinguishable from success

# Good: a terminal error state the UI/caller can branch on
    status = "ERROR"
```

**Never substitute fabricated data on failure.** Returning randomized or sample
data when a fetch fails makes the UI show plausible-but-invented numbers.

```python
# Bad: a network hiccup silently becomes made-up numbers
try:
    return fetch_metrics()
except RequestError:
    return generate_sample_data()   # user can't tell real from fake

# Good: propagate the failure (or return an explicit sentinel the UI renders as an error)
```

**Signal partial results — don't return them as complete.** A paginated fetch
that aborts mid-stream and returns what it has looks identical to a full result.

```python
# Bad: caller can't distinguish "12 items" from "12 of 900 before the API died"
def fetch_all():
    items = []
    for page in paginate():
        try:
            items.extend(page)
        except RequestError:
            break            # silent truncation
    return items

# Good: return completeness alongside the data (or raise)
    return items, complete   # caller warns loudly when complete is False
```

**Batch loops: collect per-item errors, don't just `continue`.** Skipping bad
inputs silently gives no way to know coverage was incomplete — and makes sibling
operations inconsistent when some report errors and others don't.

```python
# Bad: files that fail to load vanish with no trace
for f in files:
    try:
        process(load(f))
    except Exception:
        continue                     # how many were skipped? which ones?

# Good: accumulate skips and return them so callers (and automation) can see them
errors = []
for f in files:
    try:
        process(load(f))
    except Exception as e:
        errors.append({"file": f, "error": str(e)})
return {"processed": ..., "errors": errors}
```

The unifying rule: when you catch an error, either recover meaningfully or make
the failure **visible** (raise, log at error level, or return a distinguishable
sentinel). A `return`/`continue`/fallback inside `except` that produces
normal-looking output is where silent corruption lives.

## Determinism & Reproducibility

Non-deterministic output is a quiet tax: churny, unreviewable diffs; flaky tests;
and simulations no one can reproduce from a seed. Three sources recur.

**Serializing from an unordered container.** Building a list or JSON payload by
iterating a `set` (or merging into a dict and ranging it) emits results in an
order that varies run to run — `str` hashing is randomized per process, so a
regenerated file is the same data reshuffled, and the real change drowns in noise
in a repo whose whole point may be a clean diff. Impose a total order before you
serialize.

```python
# Bad: set iteration order isn't stable across runs
tags = [render(t) for t in tag_set]
json.dump(record, f)                     # nested sets/merges churn the output

# Good: sort before writing
tags = [render(t) for t in sorted(tag_set)]
json.dump(record, f, sort_keys=True)
```

**Multiple RNGs, none injectable.** A library that draws from both `random` and
`numpy.random` needs *both* seeded to be reproducible — seeding one leaves the
other free-running, so the run is only half-deterministic. And seeding the global
RNGs (`random.seed`, `np.random.seed`) clobbers the caller's global state. Accept
a seed (or an RNG instance) and thread local generators through, so callers get
reproducibility without you reaching into their globals.

```python
# Bad: two independent global RNGs, no way to seed from the outside
def simulate():
    x = random.random()              # stdlib global stream
    y = np.random.normal()           # numpy global — a *separate* stream

# Good: caller-supplied, local generators; one seed reproduces the whole run
def simulate(seed: int | None = None):
    rng = random.Random(seed)
    nprng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    x = rng.random()
    y = nprng.normal()
```

**Unpinned parsing context.** Locale-dependent parsing — `datetime.strptime` with
`%b`/`%a` (month/day names) — silently changes behavior across machines. Pin the
format and locale so a test that passes on your box passes in CI too.

Non-determinism also weakens tests: a function that `shuffle`s its output forces
assertions so loose ("contains any of these words") that they stop catching
regressions. Make the seam deterministic — inject the RNG — and assert exact
output.

## Pythonic Idioms

```python
# Iteration
for item in items:           # Not: for i in range(len(items))
for i, item in enumerate(items):  # When index needed

# Dictionary access
value = d.get(key, default)  # Not: if key in d: value = d[key]

# Context managers
with open(path) as f:        # Not: f = open(path); try: finally: f.close()

# Comprehensions (simple only)
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
```
