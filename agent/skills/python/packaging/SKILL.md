# Python Library Packaging

## pyproject.toml Essentials

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "my-package"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Short description"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
license = {text = "MIT"}
dependencies = []

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest>=7.0", "ruff>=0.1", "mypy>=1.0"]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/user/package"
Documentation = "https://package.readthedocs.io"

[project.scripts]
mycli = "my_package.cli:main"

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
```

## Building

```bash
uv build                     # Creates sdist + wheel in dist/
uvx twine check dist/*       # Validate metadata
```

## Publishing to PyPI

Prefer **trusted publishing** from CI (no stored token) — see the CI section
below. For a manual publish, upload with twine via `uvx`:

```bash
uvx twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*  # Test first
uvx twine upload dist/*                         # Production (uses a PyPI token)
```

## GitHub Actions (Trusted Publishing)

Publishing is automated by the canonical tag-triggered release workflow in the
`managing-python-releases` skill — one pipeline builds with `uv` and publishes via
trusted publishing. See **[../release-management/AUTOMATION.md](../release-management/AUTOMATION.md)**;
don't maintain a second copy here.

## Dependency Best Practices

```toml
# DO: Minimum versions
dependencies = ["requests>=2.28", "click>=8.0"]

# DON'T: Exact pins (locks users)
dependencies = ["requests==2.28.1"]

# DO: Optional for features
[project.optional-dependencies]
cli = ["click>=8.0"]
```

## Including Package Data

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
my_package = ["py.typed", "data/*.json"]
```

```python
from importlib.resources import files
data = files("my_package.data").joinpath("file.json").read_text()
```

## Direct-Reference Dependencies Need a Real Build

A dependency such as `toolkit @ https://example.com/toolkit.whl` may resolve in
an install dry run without invoking the build backend. With Hatchling, the real
wheel build then fails unless direct references are explicitly allowed:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "toolkit @ https://example.com/releases/toolkit.whl",
]

[tool.hatch.metadata]
allow-direct-references = true
```

Do not use `uv pip install --dry-run .` as the packaging check for this case. It
can report success without building the project. Run `uv build` (or a real
`uv pip install .`) so the configured backend validates the metadata:

```bash
uv build
uvx twine check dist/*
```

For detailed templates, see:
- **[../project-setup/PYPROJECT.md](../project-setup/PYPROJECT.md)** - Complete annotated pyproject.toml (canonical)
- **[CONDA.md](CONDA.md)** - Conda / conda-forge packaging guide

## Verify the Built Artifact (a green build is not a correct wheel)

`uv build` succeeding tells you the backend *ran*, not that the wheel
contains your code. Build backends select files via config — hatchling's
`[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` (`only-include` / `packages` / `include`),
setuptools' `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`. Get that config wrong and the
backend cheerfully ships a wheel that is missing subpackages or data files, with
no error. `twine check` won't catch it either — it validates metadata, not
contents.

**Always inspect the wheel and install it clean before publishing:**

```bash
uv build
uv run python -m zipfile -l dist/*.whl # list every file the wheel contains
# ^ confirm ALL your subpackages (my_pkg/, my_pkg/sub/) and data files are there,
#   not just the top-level module.
```

The most common footgun is over-narrow file selection. This ships *only*
`server.py` and silently drops the whole `server/` package and `data/`:

```toml
# DON'T — over-narrow include drops everything else
[tool.hatch.build]
only-include = ["server.py"]

# DO — include the package (and any data dirs); let the backend walk it
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/my_pkg"]
```

**Name-collision footgun:** never ship both a top-level module `foo.py` and a
package directory `foo/`. The package shadows the module, so `import foo`
resolves to the (often nearly empty) `foo/__init__.py`, and a console entry point
`foo = "foo:main"` fails because that package has no `main`. Pick one — usually
the package — and delete the other.

**Then prove it from a clean install, not from the source tree:**

```bash
uv venv /tmp/verify && uv pip install --python /tmp/verify/bin/python dist/*.whl
cd /tmp && /tmp/verify/bin/python -c "import my_pkg; my_pkg.submodule.real_func"
mycli --help                           # exercise each console script too
```

Run it from a directory *other than the repo root* — otherwise `import my_pkg`
picks up the source tree on `sys.path` and "works" even when the wheel is empty.
And assert on a *real symbol* (`my_pkg.submodule.real_func`), never just that the
bare top-level name imports: `import foo` can succeed against a shadowing empty
package and prove nothing. A CI smoke test that only does `import foo; print("ok")`
is a false green — it passes whether or not the distributed package is usable.

## Checklist

```
Before Release:
- [ ] pyproject.toml valid
- [ ] README.md informative
- [ ] LICENSE file exists
- [ ] Version set correctly
- [ ] twine check passes
- [ ] `uv run python -m zipfile -l dist/*.whl` shows every subpackage + data file
- [ ] Direct-reference dependencies pass a real backend build (not only install dry-run)
- [ ] No module/package name collision (no foo.py AND foo/)
- [ ] Installed the wheel into a clean venv and imported a real submodule
      symbol from a directory outside the repo (not just the top-level name)
- [ ] Each console script runs after a clean install

After Release:
- [ ] pip install works
- [ ] Import works
- [ ] GitHub release created
```
